# Joint Policy-Value Learning for Recommendation
Source code for our paper "Joint Policy-Value Learning for Recommendation" published at KDD 2020.

## Reproducibility
To generate a virtual Python environment that holds all the packages our work relies on, run:

    virtualenv -p python3 dual_bandit
    source dual_bandit/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
Now, you can run any of the three ''RunABTest'' files to run all experimental results corresponding to a column in Fig. 2 of the paper.
For example:

    python3 src/RunABTest_Uniform.py
